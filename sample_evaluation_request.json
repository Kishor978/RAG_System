This enables more efficient retrieval and processing of relevant information. There are different chunking strategies: fixed-size chunking divides the text into chunks of a predefined size, while recursive character chunking uses hierarchical splitting based on separators like paragraphs, sentences, and words."

Qdrant is an open-source vector database that provides approximate nearest neighbor search capabilities with a focus on filtering support. It uses various distance metrics like cosine similarity and dot product for finding similar vectors."

These embeddings enable semantic search capabilities in RAG systems."
